# JS-Mastery
This repository documents my personal journey of learning JavaScript. From the fundamentals to more advanced concepts, I'm using this space to organize notes, practice exercises, and small projects as I grow my skills. It's a work-in-progress learning log, and I'm sharing it both to track my progress and help others who might be on a similar path.
